# Project Instructions

## Critical Rules

1. **Always read `claude.md` before doing anything** to make sure it follows the goal and plan. If it seems off, ask me about it before you do anything so we're on the same page.

2. **Dev Server Management:**
   - Every time you make a code change or update, force refresh or restart the dev server so that the changes show up in my browser automatically.
   - When you start a dev server, stick with that 1 unless you are told otherwise.
   - Don't start up new dev servers and have multiple running in the background unless you are told otherwise.
